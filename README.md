# PixelDetails
This project allows you to see the details of a pixel at the current location of the mouse pointer. The current build provides mouse pointer coordinates, RGB values, HSV values, Hex values, and a panel for you to view the pixel color in a larger area. This program is written purely in Java, meaning that it can run on all systems supported by Java. There are no additional libraries to configure.

## Prerequisites

### Java
* [Java Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

## Getting Started

### Installing Java
Installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) is only a requirement for developers. Users who plan to solely use the program (run the pre-built JAR file) are only required to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The minimum compiler compliance is 1.6, meaning that systems with installations of Java 6 and above can run the JAR. Simply install the version of your choice for your operating system, and you're ready to get some PixelDetails!
