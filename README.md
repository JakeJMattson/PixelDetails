# PixelDetails
This project allows you to see the details of a pixel at the current mouse pointer. The current build provides mouse pointer coordinates, RGB values, HSV values, Hex values, and a panel for you to view the pixel color in a larger area. This program is written purely in Java, meaning that it can run on all systems supported by Java. There are no additional libraries to configure.

## Getting Started

### Installing Java
Installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) is only a requirement for developers. Users who only wish to run the pre-built JAR file can download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) instead. Simply install the version of your choice for your operating system, and you're ready to get some PixelDetails! The current compiler compliance is set to 1.6, meaning that all future versions of Java can also run the JAR.
